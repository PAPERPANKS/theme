                            <p>AP Janmabhoomi Success StoriesSpandana strives to mainstream children with disabilities (CWDs). 
                            Many of these children are orphans and most are unable to go through the basic routine of a day without 
                            considerable help. In addition to speech and physical therapy, it provides food, shelter and clothing to 
                            more than 40 physically challanged children.</p>

						<h5 class="card-description">
                            <p>Most of the NRIs living especially in western countries could easily compare the kind of facilities and life a mentally/physically challenged person get there when compared to India. For a country with over 1.2 billion population, you hardly would see options/places that offer any kind of care to such people.
                            <br/>
                            Raji Muppala, an NRI living in Kansas (USA), has been helping to sustain and develop this 
                            home  since 2009. Instead of just contributing some money like most, she has been 
                            coordanating the fund raising, planning and monitoring the execution of various activities 
                            working through Asha for Education. She has been instrumental in realizing the dream of own 
                            building, getting faculty and equipment for rehabilitation. Her dedicated contributions were 
                            recognized by Sprint, the company she works for, through the Community Leadership Award 
                            presented by Dan Hesse (CEO of Sprint in 2012).</p>
